# Project 1 Revisited
 Week 17 - (Core) Project 1 Revisited: Importances and Coefficients


![top3_largest_coefficients](https://github.com/RJKool/Project-1-Revisited/assets/123280849/e54409fb-db7d-4d68-9c5e-a63da3049c66)


The 3 largest coefficients are:
1.  "Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3" - If the Outlet Type is of category "Supermarket Type3", the predicted item sales for an outlet with this type increases by 2248.745.
2.  "Item_MRP" - Individual item sale price increased outlet sales by 954.767
3.  "Outlet_Type_Grocery Store" - If the Outlet Type is of category "Grocery Store", the predicted item sales for an outlet with this type decreased by 1644.829.

The top five most important features are:
1.  Item_MRP
2.  Outlet_Type_Grocery Store - where Grocery Store is second most important categorical feature used by the model during the training process.
3.  Item_Visibility
4.  Outlet_Type_Supermarket Type3 - where Supermarket Type3 Store is fourth most important categorical feature used by the model during the training process.
5.  Item_Weight

What is an "important" feature?


* An "important' feature is one that was used extensively/repeatedly by the model when during the training process. Feature Importance does not indicate directionality.
